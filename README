node-crypto
===========

A wrapper around openssl for node.js, currently exposing Hashing, Signing
and Verifying methods.

Version 0.0.5 : test.js now uses mjsunit

Version 0.0.4 : Added package.json and updated tests to latest node version.

Version 0.0.3 : Added cipher / decipher, thanks to Frans-Willem Hardijzer.

To install, ensure that you have openssl installed, and run:

node-waf configure 
node-waf build

This will put the crypto.node binary module in build/default. 

The hashing, signing and verifying methods can work with binary, hex or 
base64 encoded strings.

The encrypt / decrypt methods work with binary, hex or base64 encodings,
with streaming.

See test.js for example usage.
